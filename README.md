Procedure

1.Input Processing:
The system takes two frames (Frame i and Frame j) as input
Each frame appears to contain sequential images  in motion
The frames are processed to create canonical volumes (G_dy, G_ik, G_jk)

2.Transformation Branches:
The system employs both Dynamic and Static transformations:
◦ Dynamic Transformations (T_i^dy and T_j^dy): Handle moving elements
◦ Static Transformations (T_i^st and T_j^st): Process stationary elements

3.Feature Extraction:
MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) modules process the canonical volumes
Outputs include:
◦ RGB information
◦ Density measurements
◦ Feature vectors (f^dy)
◦ Conﬁdence scores (β^st)

4.Volume Fusion:
A central "Volume fusion M(·,·)" module integrates information from both static and dynamic pathways
This appears to create a uniﬁed representation of the tracked object

5.Technical Innovations:
The use of canonical volumes suggests the system can handle 3D spatial relationships
Dual-pathway architecture (static/dynamic) likely improves tracking accuracy by separately handling moving and stationary elements
The conﬁdence scores suggest the system implements uncertainty estimation

6.Practical Applications:
◦ General object tracking in dynamic environments
◦ Motion analysis in video sequences
